# Lab exercise 2 objectives
1. Write C++ programs
2. Compile C++ programs
3. Implement programs that use `std::cin` and `std::cout` correctly
4. Implement mathematical expressions in C++
5. Implement code that formats floating-point output correctly

# Instructions
Answer the programming problems sequentially (i.e., answer prob01 before prob02). If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates. However, take note that asking questions will "reset" your three-right-in-a-row count.

When you answer three programming problems correctly in a row, let your instructor know and wait for further instruction.
